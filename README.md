# Masmovil React Extensions Pack

This is a pack with the extensions I use and recommend to my coworkers, so we can activate/deactivate between workspaces easier.
For example, when working with react and angular projects the process of whitelisting workspace only extensions is kind of tedious.

## Configuration

This is the first iteration of this idea, and I don't want to expend too much time on it if it doesn't feel useful after a while.
When needed I'll add some custom configurations for the extensions _(even vscode itself)_ here
