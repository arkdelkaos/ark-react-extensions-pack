This is a pack with the extensions I use and recommend to my coworkers, so we can activate/deactivate between workspaces easier.
For example, when working with react and angular projects the process of whitelisting workspace only extensions is kind of tedious.

## Included Extensions

### Do I need all those extensions?

Maybe. You can just disable any extension you don't want to use.
But I recommend you to try them.
- The ones with the icon 🔥 are my favorites!
- Those with the icon 🔒 are a must!

Having less extensions running at the same time will always return a better performance.
But remember that not all extensions are running in the background!: those "on demand" (command palette) extensions weight almost nothing performance wise.
- The extensions with the icon ⚙️ can be kind of heavy on performance

I'll try to explain why I use every extension and how to configure it, **but feel free to add a new PR with any change proposal**.

- Docker: All the Docker related tools you may need, from management to syntax highlighting.

## Configuration

This is the first iteration of this idea, and I don't want to expend too much time adding complexity if the initiative doesn't feel useful after a while.
When needed I'll add some custom configurations for the extensions _(even vscode itself)_ here
